# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the PyBer Analysis

In this analysis, I used Pandas library and Python in Jupyter Notebook in order to create a summary DataFrame of ride-sharing data by city type. I also utilized Matplotlib to create a multiple-line graph to show the total weekly fares for each city type. The goal is to examine how the data differs by city type.

## Results

This summary data frame shows that there are differences between ride-sharing fares among the three different types of cities:

The data frame shows the total rides, total number of drivers, total amount of fares, average fare per ride, average fare per driver, and total fare by city type. 

Urban cities had the most total rides and most total drivers by a vast majority.

There are a lot more drivers in urban cities as well. There were 2,405 urban drivers, only 490 suburban drivers, and a mere 78 drivers in rural areas.

However, the average fare for rural cities and average fare per driver are highest in rural areas.

The line plot below compares the total fares by city type for rides that took place between January 1, 2019 and April 28, 2019.
Urban cities (shown as a yellow line) had the highest total fares compared to rural and suburban cities in the same timeframe.

## Summary 

Three business recommendations that I would make for addressing the disparities among the city types are:
1. If rural cities need more drivers, incentivizing current drivers to consider accepting rural and suburban rides when needed could be beneficial since the data shows that rural fares are highest on average and overall amongst the three city types. Another fact that supports this is that there is likely less competition among rural drivers, and possibly less idle time between rides that is not used to complete rides.
2. There is a good opportunity to expand the business by hiring more drivers in rural and suburban cities.
3. Increasing rates for fares, especially in urban rides and during peak hours, would increase profits. The demand for urban rides is highest, as evidenced by the highest total amount of fares and total rides.
